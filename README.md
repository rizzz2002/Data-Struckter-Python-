Certainly! Here's a concise README for your GitHub repository focused on problem-solving with data structures in Python:

Problem Solving with Data Structures in Python
Welcome to my repository dedicated to problem-solving with data structures using Python! Here, you'll find a collection of solutions to various algorithmic problems, all implemented in Python.


About:
In this repository, I explore fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more. Each solution is crafted to demonstrate efficient manipulation and utilization of these data structures to solve common algorithmic challenges.


Contents:
Python Scripts: Implementation of algorithms and problem-solving techniques using Python.
Problem Statements: Descriptions of problems tackled along with their respective solutions.
Documentation: Additional resources and explanations for better understanding.


How to Use:
Feel free to explore the Python scripts and problem statements provided. You can run the scripts locally to observe the solutions in action. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
